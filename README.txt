   These are the macros I've built up over
   my years of using jEdit. Feel free to
   use or modify them as you see fit--if
   you make improvements, please let me
   know!
   
   
* USAGE:

   The macros themselves are in "JP".
   
   Put "00_JP_Macro_Utils.bsh" in your "startup"
   folder (in the jEdit settings directory).
   
   Documentation is found in the "doc"
   directory. JARs that some macros depend
   on are in the "jars" directory.


* The most frequently useful macros, in my opinion, are
   
     Align on Character (and its two helpers)
     Box Selection
     Enumerate Lines
     Evaluate Preceding Expression
     Fill Paragraph
     Insert Hex Unicode
     Insert Line Below
     Reflow Selection (Quickstart: use Copy as Softflow)
     Repeat Character
